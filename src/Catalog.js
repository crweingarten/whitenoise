        info: `I started doing yoga in earnest in 2012, going three times a week to the studio by my house. Their choice of music was always distracting. I remember, going into a pigeon pose sequence, that a Fleet Foxes track cued up. I was sweating on my yoga mat, thinking, "This is probably the worst context in which one could listen to Fleet Foxes." I like Fleet Foxes in the car or when I'm cooking. I don't like Fleet Foxes when I'm trying to do pigeon pose.\n\nIt got me thinking about my ideal musical accompaniment for an exercise such as yoga — not just yoga, but any type of exercise wherein there is a mindful element. Ambient music has a tendency toward repetition, which I didn't want. New age music makes me feel alienated. Classical music just makes me think of my day job. I ruminated on this problem for years.\n\nThen, in 2024, Christopher Weingarten e-mailed me out of the blue, asking me if I'd like to be paid to make some white noise for him. I immediately said yes, without knowing what the specifics were. When he described the Fuzzzel app, and what the noise was to be used for, I immediately felt like my "yoga music" problem was solved by his suggestion.\n\nI thought about it and built a synth patch in my head which I called a "noise organ" — white noise being kissed by resonant filters to allow for improvisation. I built the patch and recorded a series of tracks; among them was "Wake (i)." I hope you find it clarifying and useful.`
