We got a substantially cheaper rate using the studio during the off-hours, so sessions would begin around 11pm and go to about 8am. This meant most of my sleeping was done while Brooklyn's various go-getters, creatives and drones were flitting about in their various commutes, lunch breaks, traffic jams, arguments and conversations. Around day 3 I realized I needed something to drown out the cacophony. Before the night's session, I brewed up this track using a MiniMoog Model D for the washes of low end, and a stylophone through a RAT pedal for the high end. It helped me sleep soundly for the next two weeks.`},
